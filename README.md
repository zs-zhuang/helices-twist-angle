# Summary

This repository contains a script that estimates the twist angles within RNA helices as shown in the image (RNA_twist_angle.png). For the scripts to work, one must provide a list of protein data bank files (pdb structures such as 1grz, 2avy, 2aw4 etc.). In addition, for each pdb file, four positions/residues of interest must also be provided (such as residue 311, 264, 312 and 262 from 1grz.pdb).
